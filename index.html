 <p>The DITA Open Toolkit, or DITA-OT for short, is a set of Java-based, open source tools that provide processing for DITA maps and topic content.</p>
 <p>You can download the toolkit and install it for free to get started with topic-based writing and publishing.</p>

<h2>Features of the DITA Open Toolkit</h2>
<p>The DITA Open Toolkit is primarily a publishing tool – it is intended to convert DITA content into various output formats. This topic describes which versions of DITA are supported as input; it also describes the output formats available in a default installation.</p>
<h3 id="supported_versions_of_dita">Supported versions of DITA</h3>
<p>The toolkit supports all standard versions of DITA, including 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, with preview support for 1.3. In addition, it will still process documents that were written according to the pre-OASIS version of DITA, often called "dita132".</p>
<h3 id="supported_transformation_types">Supported transformation types</h3>
<p>The following transformation types are supported out of the box with any toolkit installation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p><strong>PDF</strong> - PDF output is based on a plug-in that produces XSL-FO output. The XSL-FO output may be converted to PDF using an open source tools (Apache FOP) or using commercial tools such as RenderX or Antenna House Formatter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>HTML5 and XHTML</strong> - HTML output is supported together with a variety of HTML-based navigation types. Navigation is not required. The HTML output contains class values based on the DITA elements so CSS files may be used to customize the output style.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Eclipse Help</strong> - Eclipse output is an XHTML based format that also produces navigation and index files for use with Eclipse information centers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>TocJS</strong> - The TocJS transformation type includes XHTML output along with JavaScript based frames for navigation, including TOC sections that expand and collapse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>HTML Help</strong> - Microsoft Compiled HTML Help output produces a compiled help (.chm) file with the XHTML topics, table of contents, and index.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Java Help</strong> - Java Help includes a table of contents and index for use with the Java Help platform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>OpenDocument</strong> - ODT is a document format based on the ODF standard, for use with tools like Open Office.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Rich Text Format</strong> - RTF output is supported for basic content, but complex markup and some advanced features of DITA may not be supported.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>troff</strong> - troff based man pages are supported; one man page is generated for each input topic. Note that tables are not supported by this transformation type.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The toolkit’s plug-in mechanism allows new transformation types to be added. Note that both TocJS and PDF2 were originally separately installable plug-ins, which became widespread enough that they are now bundled together with the default toolkit installation.</p>
